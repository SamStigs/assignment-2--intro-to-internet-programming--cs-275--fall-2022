Sam's ReadMe:

Accomplishments on this assignment:
	1. get all the gulp tasks to work, YAY, it actually does make life easier when you press save and shit automatically just updates. sweet. I wasn't able to get those to work for assignment one, so this feels like a rad accomplishment for me. 
	2. I have zero experience in HTML, CSS and obviously JS. I got Each slide to be in a line, and also used the Z-index. Before I lined them up, they were indeed on top of each other, and I was able to confirm by changing the z indexes. 
	3. Manipulating the container is getting me. 
	4. obviously because I have not yet mastered the making of objects and styling them properly, i was not able to move into the ACTIONS with the JS. Still feel pretty decent about it though. 

Thanks for reading.
